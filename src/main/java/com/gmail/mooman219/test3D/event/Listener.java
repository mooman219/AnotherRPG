    // Yeah, this listens to suff. Kinda. Not really, I don't know why I just lied to you right there.
    // It was kinda for no reason. Anywho, if you implement this, then basically,
    // it just says you have a method somewhere in you that can recieve events.
    // It's not the end of the world if you don't, but it makes things nice, neat, and organized.
